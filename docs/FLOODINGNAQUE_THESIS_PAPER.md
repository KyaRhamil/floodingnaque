## ABSTRACT

Flooding remains a critical challenge in Parañaque City, Metro Manila, Philippines, with recurrent incidents causing substantial damage to property, infrastructure, and posing significant risks to human life. This study presents Floodingnaque, a proposed real-time flood detection and early warning system that integrates weather Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to predict flood occurrences. The system utilizes multiple weather data sources including Meteostat for historical weather data and OpenWeatherMap for real-time meteorological information. The Random Forest classifier was trained using official flood records from the Parañaque City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO) spanning 2022 to 2025, comprising 1,182 documented flood events across multiple barangays. The training dataset was expanded to 13,698 balanced samples including both flood and non-flood instances. The model incorporates key features including precipitation, temperature, humidity, monsoon season indicators, and engineered interaction features. A progressive training approach was employed, demonstrating model evolution from baseline (2022 data) to the comprehensive cumulative dataset (2022-2025). The trained model achieved an accuracy of 100%, precision of 100%, recall of 100%, and F1-score of 100% on the official records dataset, with precipitation identified as the most influential feature (importance score: 0.3377). The system implements a three-level risk classification scheme (Safe, Alert, Critical) to facilitate timely response actions. This research contributes to disaster risk reduction efforts by providing an accessible, data-driven approach to flood prediction that can support local government units in protecting communities from flood-related hazards.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters affecting urban areas worldwide, and the Philippines, particularly Metro Manila, is highly susceptible due to its geographic location, topography, and climate patterns (Briones, 2020). Parañaque City, situated in the southern part of Metro Manila, experiences frequent flooding during the monsoon season (June to November) and during localized thunderstorms throughout the year. The city's proximity to Manila Bay, its low-lying terrain, and rapid urbanization have exacerbated flood vulnerability, making timely flood prediction and warning essential for protecting residents and minimizing damage (Cruz & Narisma, 2019).

Traditional flood monitoring approaches often rely on manual observations and reactive responses, which may not provide sufficient lead time for communities to prepare and evacuate. The advancement of machine learning technologies and the availability of real-time weather data through APIs present opportunities to develop proactive flood prediction systems (Ahmed & Alim, 2021). The integration of these technologies can enable local government units to issue timely warnings and implement preventive measures before flooding occurs.

The Random Forest algorithm has emerged as a reliable machine learning technique for environmental prediction tasks due to its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships between features, resistance to overfitting, and interpretability through feature importance analysis (Liu & Chen, 2022). Unlike single decision trees, Random Forest constructs an ensemble of decision trees and aggregates their predictions through majority voting, resulting in more robust and accurate classifications (Chen & Guestrin, 2016).

This study aims to develop Floodingnaque, a real-time flood detection and early warning system for Parañaque City that combines weather API data integration with Random Forest-based flood prediction. The specific objectives of this research are: (1) to design and implement a system architecture that integrates multiple weather data sources through APIs; (2) to train a Random Forest classifier using official flood records from the Parañaque City DRRMO; (3) to evaluate the prediction performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics; and (4) to implement a three-level risk classification system that translates predictions into actionable warnings.

The significance of this study lies in its potential to enhance disaster preparedness and response in Parañaque City. By leveraging official government flood records and real-time weather data, the system provides a localized solution tailored to the specific flood patterns and conditions of the area. The research also demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in disaster risk reduction, contributing to the growing body of knowledge on data-driven approaches for urban flood management in the Philippine context.

### Scope and Limitations

**Scope:**
This study focuses on the development of a flood prediction system specifically for Parañaque City, Metro Manila, Philippines. The research encompasses:

1. **Geographic Scope**: The 16 barangays of Parañaque City, with particular attention to flood-prone areas documented in official DRRMO records.

2. **Temporal Scope**: Official flood records from 2022 to 2025, and PAGASA weather data from 2020 to 2025.

3. **Technical Scope**: Development of a web-based flood prediction system using Random Forest algorithm, weather API integration, and a three-level risk classification system.

4. **Data Sources**: Official flood records from Parañaque City DRRMO, climatological data from PAGASA weather stations (Port Area, NAIA, Science Garden), satellite precipitation data from Google Earth Engine, and tidal data from WorldTides API.

**Limitations:**

1. **Data Availability**: The system relies on the availability and accuracy of external weather APIs. Service interruptions or API changes may affect real-time predictions.

2. **Localized Rainfall**: Weather station data may not capture highly localized rainfall variations within individual barangays. Microclimate effects are not fully accounted for.

3. **Historical Data Period**: The four-year historical dataset (2022-2025) may not capture long-term climate patterns or rare extreme weather events.

4. **Infrastructure Dependencies**: The system requires stable internet connectivity and server availability for real-time operation.

5. **Validation Constraints**: Real-time validation of predictions against actual flood events requires ongoing coordination with DRRMO, which was outside the scope of this initial development phase.

6. **Flood Depth Prediction**: The current model predicts flood occurrence (binary classification) but does not predict specific flood depth levels.

### Conceptual Framework

The Floodingnaque system is built upon an Input-Process-Output (IPO) conceptual framework that integrates multiple data sources through machine learning for flood prediction:

## II. REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

### A. Flood Risk and Impact in Urban Areas

Urban flooding poses significant challenges to cities worldwide, with climate change and rapid urbanization intensifying flood risks (Zhang & Li, 2023). In the Philippines, Metro Manila experiences recurring flood events that cause economic losses, displacement of residents, and loss of life. Briones (2020) highlighted that flood hazard mapping and early warning efforts in Metro Manila have been hampered by limited data availability and the need for localized prediction systems. Cruz and Narisma (2019) examined climate change adaptation and flood resilience in Philippine cities, emphasizing the importance of integrating technological solutions with community-based disaster risk reduction strategies.

The Parañaque City DRRMO has documented 1,182 distinct flood events from 2022 to 2025, with incidents occurring across various barangays including San Dionisio, San Isidro, San Antonio, Vitalez, Sun Valley, and Marcelo Green, among others. These records indicate that flood depths range from gutter level to waist level, with weather disturbances ranging from localized thunderstorms to Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) phenomena.

### B. Machine Learning for Flood Prediction

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful approach for flood forecasting and risk assessment. Ahmed and Alim (2021) conducted a comprehensive review of machine learning algorithms for flood prediction, identifying ensemble methods such as Random Forest as particularly effective for handling the complex relationships between meteorological variables and flood occurrence. Jain and Kumar (2020) compared various machine learning models for flood forecasting and found that ensemble algorithms consistently outperformed single models in terms of accuracy and generalization.

Muhammad and Rahman (2021) evaluated ensemble learning algorithms for flood hazard classification, demonstrating that Random Forest achieved superior performance compared to other classifiers when applied to environmental datasets. Liu and Chen (2022) specifically applied Random Forest to rainfall prediction for urban flood prevention, achieving high accuracy in classifying flood risk levels based on precipitation patterns.

### C. Random Forest Algorithm

The Random Forest algorithm, introduced by Breiman (2001), constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification tasks. Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and at each node, a random subset of features is considered for splitting (Chen & Guestrin, 2016). This randomization reduces correlation among trees and improves the ensemble's generalization ability.

Key advantages of Random Forest for flood prediction include: (1) ability to handle high-dimensional data with minimal preprocessing; (2) robustness to outliers and noise in weather data; (3) provision of feature importance scores that aid in understanding prediction drivers; and (4) resistance to overfitting even with complex datasets. The algorithm's parameters, including the number of estimators (trees), maximum depth, and minimum samples for splitting, can be optimized through techniques such as grid search cross-validation.

### D. Weather Data APIs for Real-Time Monitoring

The availability of weather data through APIs has enabled the development of real-time disaster monitoring systems. OpenWeatherMap (2024) provides comprehensive weather data including current conditions, forecasts, and historical observations through its RESTful API. Meteostat (2024) offers free access to historical weather data from global weather stations, making it valuable for training machine learning models and validating predictions.

Khurshid and Lee (2019) demonstrated the integration of IoT and weather data APIs for real-time disaster monitoring, highlighting the importance of redundant data sources to ensure system reliability. Santos (2022) investigated API integration in local early warning systems in the Philippines, providing evidence of the effectiveness of web-based solutions for disaster preparedness in the local context.

### E. Disaster Risk Reduction in the Philippines

The Philippine government has established frameworks for disaster risk reduction at national and local levels. The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG, 2023) provides guidelines on disaster risk reduction management, mandating local government units to implement early warning systems and emergency response protocols. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA, 2023) serves as the primary source for weather data and flood bulletins, supporting disaster preparedness efforts nationwide.

The Department of Science and Technology-PAGASA (2024) maintains climate monitoring stations across Metro Manila, including Port Area, NAIA, and Science Garden stations, which provide valuable meteorological data for flood prediction research. These stations record daily rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind observations that can be integrated into predictive models.

### F. Local Studies on Flood Prediction

Parayno (2021) demonstrated the application of machine learning models in localized flood forecasting in the Philippines, providing precedent for using Random Forest in the Philippine setting. Manila Observatory (2020) explored urban flood modeling and warning systems, reinforcing the need for data-based solutions tailored to Metro Manila's unique flooding characteristics. Villanueva and Dela Cruz (2020) highlighted data-driven approaches for disaster mitigation in the National Capital Region, validating the relevance of technological solutions to current government digital transformation initiatives.

### G. Synthetic Data Generation for Machine Learning

In research environments where labeled data is scarce or inaccessible, synthetic data generation provides an alternative for model development and validation. Patki, Wedge, and Veeramachaneni (2016) introduced the Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets that preserve the statistical properties of original data. This approach has been applied in various domains where privacy concerns or data limitations prevent the use of actual records for training machine learning models.

| 5 | temp_humidity_interaction | 0.0320 |
| 6 | monsoon_precip_interaction | 0.0272 |

| 8 | month | 0.0212 |
| 9 | temperature | 0.0206 |
| 10 | saturation_risk | 0.0194 |

The analysis indicates that precipitation is the dominant predictor of flood occurrence, accounting for approximately 33.77% of the model's predictive power. The engineered interaction features (humidity_precip_interaction and temp_precip_interaction) collectively contribute over 46% of the importance, demonstrating the value of feature engineering in capturing complex relationships between meteorological variables.

### C. Progressive Training Results

The progressive training approach demonstrated consistent performance across all model versions:

**Table 7. Progressive Training Performance Summary**

| Version | Dataset | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| v1 | 2022 Only (1,272 samples) | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| v2 | 2022-2023 (3,450 samples) | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| v3 | 2022-2024 (5,970 samples) | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| v4 | 2022-2025 (13,698 samples) | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| v5 | PAGASA Data (4,944 samples) | 0.9848 | 0.9852 | 0.9848 | 0.9849 |
| v6 | Combined (18,021 samples) | 0.9675 | 0.9679 | 0.9675 | 0.9677 |

The consistent performance across versions trained on official records validates the quality and consistency of the DRRMO flood documentation. The slight decrease in performance for v5 and v6 when incorporating PAGASA weather data reflects the introduction of additional variability and the challenge of matching weather station observations with localized flood events.

### D. Threshold Analysis

Analysis of prediction probability distributions revealed clear separation between flood and non-flood classes:

- Maximum probability for no-flood predictions: 10.16%
- Minimum probability for flood predictions: 24.13%
- Separation gap: 13.97 percentage points

This substantial gap indicates that the model produces confident predictions with minimal uncertainty in the boundary region, supporting reliable risk classification.

### E. System Integration

The Floodingnaque system successfully integrates the trained model with real-time weather data services. Key integration components include:

**1. API Endpoints:**
- POST /predict: Accepts weather parameters and returns flood prediction with risk classification
- GET /api/models: Lists available model versions
- GET /status: Returns system health status

**2. Weather Data Integration:**
- Meteostat Service: Configured for Parañaque City coordinates (14.4793°N, 121.0198°E)
- Default search radius: 100km for nearby weather stations
- Automatic station selection based on data availability

**3. Risk Classification Output:**
The system provides comprehensive prediction responses including:
- Binary prediction (flood/no flood)
- Probability estimates for each class
- Risk level (0, 1, or 2)
- Risk label (Safe, Alert, or Critical)
- Risk color code for visualization
- Descriptive text for recommended actions

### F. Discussion

The results demonstrate that the Random Forest algorithm, when trained on high-quality official flood records combined with PAGASA weather station data, achieves strong predictive performance for flood detection in Parañaque City. The v6 model's 96.75% accuracy on the combined dataset of 18,021 samples reflects real-world variability while maintaining high reliability.

The progressive training approach revealed interesting patterns: models trained exclusively on official records (v1-v4) achieved 100% accuracy, while the introduction of PAGASA weather station data in v5 and v6 introduced natural variability that slightly reduced accuracy but improved generalization. This trade-off is beneficial for real-world deployment where the model must handle diverse weather conditions.

The dominance of precipitation as a predictive feature (33.77% importance) aligns with the understanding that rainfall intensity is the primary driver of urban flooding. The significant contribution of engineered interaction features—humidity-precipitation interaction (25.53%) and temperature-precipitation interaction (20.85%)—demonstrates that the combination of multiple weather factors provides substantial predictive value beyond individual features alone, collectively accounting for over 79% of the model's decision-making.

The integration of multiple data sources strengthens the system's reliability:
- **PAGASA weather stations** provide localized, ground-truth meteorological observations
- **WorldTides tidal data** accounts for coastal flooding risks in Manila Bay
- **Google Earth Engine satellite data** offers independent precipitation estimates for validation
- **Meteostat historical data** enables cost-effective model training and historical analysis

The three-level risk classification system translates model outputs into actionable information that can support decision-making by local government officials and community members. The probability thresholds (Safe < 0.30, Alert 0.30-0.75, Critical ≥ 0.75) were calibrated with additional conditions for precipitation and humidity levels to balance sensitivity with specificity.

Limitations of the current study include: (1) the reliance on weather station data that may not capture localized rainfall variations within individual barangays, (2) the need for continuous API availability for real-time predictions, and (3) the challenge of validating predictions against actual flood events in real-time. Future iterations should incorporate radar-based precipitation data and conduct validation with independent test datasets from neighboring municipalities.

## V. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Conclusion

This study successfully developed Floodingnaque, a real-time flood detection and early warning system for Parañaque City that integrates multiple weather APIs, satellite data, and tidal information with Random Forest-based machine learning prediction. The following conclusions are drawn from the research:

1. **Comprehensive System Architecture**: The integration of Flask-based backend APIs with five weather data services (Meteostat, OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, WorldTides, and Google Earth Engine) provides a robust, redundant, and scalable architecture for flood prediction. The system successfully retrieves, processes, and utilizes multi-source weather data for prediction purposes, with Docker containerization ensuring consistent deployment across environments.

2. **Strong Prediction Accuracy**: The Random Forest classifier achieved 96.75% accuracy, 96.79% precision, 96.75% recall, and 96.77% F1-score on the combined dataset of 18,021 samples. The production model (v6) balances high accuracy with real-world generalization by incorporating both official flood records and PAGASA weather station data.

3. **Significant Feature Insights**: Feature importance analysis identified precipitation as the primary predictor (33.77%), followed by humidity-precipitation interaction (25.53%) and temperature-precipitation interaction (20.85%). These three features collectively account for approximately 80% of the model's predictive power, validating the importance of rainfall data and demonstrating the value of engineered interaction features.

4. **Practical Risk Classification**: The three-level risk classification system (Safe, Alert, Critical) effectively translates model predictions into actionable warnings. The classification logic incorporates probability thresholds with additional conditions for precipitation (10-30mm) and humidity (>85%) levels, ensuring appropriate alert escalation under borderline conditions.

5. **Value of Multi-Source Data**: The integration of official DRRMO flood records (1,182 events across 2022-2025), PAGASA climatological data from three weather stations, satellite precipitation from Google Earth Engine, and tidal data from WorldTides provides a comprehensive foundation for locally-relevant flood prediction.

6. **Modern Frontend Implementation**: The React + Vite + TypeScript frontend with interactive Leaflet maps, Recharts visualizations, and responsive Tailwind CSS design provides an accessible user interface suitable for both technical operators and community members.
