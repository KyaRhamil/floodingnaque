ABSTRACT

Flooding remains a critical challenge in Paranaque City, Metro Manila, Philippines, with recurrent incidents causing substantial damage to property, infrastructure, and posing significant risks to human life. This study presents Floodingnaque, a proposed real-time flood detection and early warning system that integrates weather Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to predict flood occurrences. The system utilizes multiple weather data sources including Meteostat for historical weather data and OpenWeatherMap for real-time meteorological information. The Random Forest classifier was trained using official flood records from the Paranaque City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO) spanning 2022 to 2025, comprising over 3,700 documented flood events and 13,698 training samples. The model incorporates key features including precipitation, temperature, humidity, monsoon season indicators, and engineered interaction features. A progressive training approach was employed, demonstrating model evolution from baseline (2022 data with 1,272 samples) to the comprehensive cumulative dataset (2022-2025 with 13,698 samples). The trained model achieved an accuracy of 100 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 100 percent, and F1-score of 100 percent on the official records dataset, with precipitation identified as the most influential feature (importance score: 0.3377). The system implements a three-level risk classification scheme (Safe, Alert, Critical) to facilitate timely response actions. This research contributes to disaster risk reduction efforts by providing an accessible, data-driven approach to flood prediction that can support local government units in protecting communities from flood-related hazards.

I. INTRODUCTION

Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters affecting urban areas worldwide, and the Philippines, particularly Metro Manila, is highly susceptible due to its geographic location, topography, and climate patterns (Briones, 2020). Paranaque City, situated in the southern part of Metro Manila, experiences frequent flooding during the monsoon season (June to November) and during localized thunderstorms throughout the year. The city's proximity to Manila Bay, its low-lying terrain, and rapid urbanization have exacerbated flood vulnerability, making timely flood prediction and warning essential for protecting residents and minimizing damage (Cruz & Narisma, 2019).

Traditional flood monitoring approaches often rely on manual observations and reactive responses, which may not provide sufficient lead time for communities to prepare and evacuate. The advancement of machine learning technologies and the availability of real-time weather data through APIs present opportunities to develop proactive flood prediction systems (Ahmed & Alim, 2021). The integration of these technologies can enable local government units to issue timely warnings and implement preventive measures before flooding occurs.

The Random Forest algorithm has emerged as a reliable machine learning technique for environmental prediction tasks due to its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships between features, resistance to overfitting, and interpretability through feature importance analysis (Liu & Chen, 2022). Unlike single decision trees, Random Forest constructs an ensemble of decision trees and aggregates their predictions through majority voting, resulting in more robust and accurate classifications (Chen & Guestrin, 2016).

This study aims to develop Floodingnaque, a real-time flood detection and early warning system for Paranaque City that combines weather API data integration with Random Forest-based flood prediction. The specific objectives of this research are: (1) to design and implement a system architecture that integrates multiple weather data sources through APIs; (2) to train a Random Forest classifier using official flood records from the Paranaque City DRRMO; (3) to evaluate the prediction performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics; and (4) to implement a three-level risk classification system that translates predictions into actionable warnings.

The significance of this study lies in its potential to enhance disaster preparedness and response in Paranaque City. By leveraging official government flood records and real-time weather data, the system provides a localized solution tailored to the specific flood patterns and conditions of the area. The research also demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in disaster risk reduction, contributing to the growing body of knowledge on data-driven approaches for urban flood management in the Philippine context.


II. REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

A. Flood Risk and Impact in Urban Areas

Urban flooding poses significant challenges to cities worldwide, with climate change and rapid urbanization intensifying flood risks (Zhang & Li, 2023). In the Philippines, Metro Manila experiences recurring flood events that cause economic losses, displacement of residents, and loss of life. Briones (2020) highlighted that flood hazard mapping and early warning efforts in Metro Manila have been hampered by limited data availability and the need for localized prediction systems. Cruz and Narisma (2019) examined climate change adaptation and flood resilience in Philippine cities, emphasizing the importance of integrating technological solutions with community-based disaster risk reduction strategies.

The Paranaque City DRRMO has documented over 3,700 flood events from 2022 to 2025, with incidents occurring across various barangays including San Dionisio, San Isidro, San Antonio, Vitalez, Sun Valley, and Marcelo Green, among others. These records indicate that flood depths range from gutter level to waist level, with weather disturbances ranging from localized thunderstorms to Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) phenomena.

B. Machine Learning for Flood Prediction

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful approach for flood forecasting and risk assessment. Ahmed and Alim (2021) conducted a comprehensive review of machine learning algorithms for flood prediction, identifying ensemble methods such as Random Forest as particularly effective for handling the complex relationships between meteorological variables and flood occurrence. Jain and Kumar (2020) compared various machine learning models for flood forecasting and found that ensemble algorithms consistently outperformed single models in terms of accuracy and generalization.

Muhammad and Rahman (2021) evaluated ensemble learning algorithms for flood hazard classification, demonstrating that Random Forest achieved superior performance compared to other classifiers when applied to environmental datasets. Liu and Chen (2022) specifically applied Random Forest to rainfall prediction for urban flood prevention, achieving high accuracy in classifying flood risk levels based on precipitation patterns.

C. Random Forest Algorithm

The Random Forest algorithm, introduced by Breiman (2001), constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification tasks. Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and at each node, a random subset of features is considered for splitting (Chen & Guestrin, 2016). This randomization reduces correlation among trees and improves the ensemble's generalization ability.

Key advantages of Random Forest for flood prediction include: (1) ability to handle high-dimensional data with minimal preprocessing; (2) robustness to outliers and noise in weather data; (3) provision of feature importance scores that aid in understanding prediction drivers; and (4) resistance to overfitting even with complex datasets. The algorithm's parameters, including the number of estimators (trees), maximum depth, and minimum samples for splitting, can be optimized through techniques such as grid search cross-validation.

D. Weather Data APIs for Real-Time Monitoring

The availability of weather data through APIs has enabled the development of real-time disaster monitoring systems. OpenWeatherMap (2024) provides comprehensive weather data including current conditions, forecasts, and historical observations through its RESTful API. Meteostat (2024) offers free access to historical weather data from global weather stations, making it valuable for training machine learning models and validating predictions.

Khurshid and Lee (2019) demonstrated the integration of IoT and weather data APIs for real-time disaster monitoring, highlighting the importance of redundant data sources to ensure system reliability. Santos (2022) investigated API integration in local early warning systems in the Philippines, providing evidence of the effectiveness of web-based solutions for disaster preparedness in the local context.

E. Disaster Risk Reduction in the Philippines

The Philippine government has established frameworks for disaster risk reduction at national and local levels. The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG, 2023) provides guidelines on disaster risk reduction management, mandating local government units to implement early warning systems and emergency response protocols. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA, 2023) serves as the primary source for weather data and flood bulletins, supporting disaster preparedness efforts nationwide.

The Department of Science and Technology-PAGASA (2024) maintains climate monitoring stations across Metro Manila, including Port Area, NAIA, and Science Garden stations, which provide valuable meteorological data for flood prediction research. These stations record daily rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind observations that can be integrated into predictive models.

F. Local Studies on Flood Prediction

Parayno (2021) demonstrated the application of machine learning models in localized flood forecasting in the Philippines, providing precedent for using Random Forest in the Philippine setting. Manila Observatory (2020) explored urban flood modeling and warning systems, reinforcing the need for data-based solutions tailored to Metro Manila's unique flooding characteristics. Villanueva and Dela Cruz (2020) highlighted data-driven approaches for disaster mitigation in the National Capital Region, validating the relevance of technological solutions to current government digital transformation initiatives.

G. Synthetic Data Generation for Machine Learning

In research environments where labeled data is scarce or inaccessible, synthetic data generation provides an alternative for model development and validation. Patki, Wedge, and Veeramachaneni (2016) introduced the Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets that preserve the statistical properties of original data. This approach has been applied in various domains where privacy concerns or data limitations prevent the use of actual records for training machine learning models.

[Figure 2: Confusion Matrix Visualization - Insert confusion_matrix.png]

B. Feature Importance Analysis

The Random Forest algorithm provides feature importance scores that indicate the relative contribution of each feature to the prediction. The analysis revealed the following ranking:

Table 7. Feature Importance Scores

| Rank | Feature | Importance Score |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | precipitation | 0.3377 |
| 2 | humidity_precip_interaction | 0.2553 |
| 3 | temp_precip_interaction | 0.2085 |

C. Progressive Training Results

The progressive training approach demonstrated consistent performance across all model versions:

Table 8. Progressive Training Performance Summary

| Version | Dataset | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| v1 | 2022 Only | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| v2 | 2022-2023 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| v3 | 2022-2024 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| v4 | 2022-2025 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| v5 | PAGASA Data | 0.9848 | 0.9852 | 0.9848 | 0.9849 | 0.9990 |
| v6 | Combined | 0.9675 | 0.9679 | 0.9675 | 0.9677 | 0.9957 |

The consistent performance across versions trained on official records validates the quality and consistency of the DRRMO flood documentation. The slight decrease in performance for v5 and v6 when incorporating PAGASA weather data reflects the introduction of additional variability and the challenge of matching weather station observations with localized flood events.

[Figure 4: Model Progression Chart - Insert model_progression_chart.png]

D. ROC Curve Analysis

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrates the model's ability to distinguish between flood and non-flood conditions across different classification thresholds.

[Figure 5: ROC Curve - Insert roc_curve.png]

The Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 1.0000 for the official records model indicates perfect discrimination ability, while the combined dataset model achieved an AUC of 0.9957, still demonstrating excellent classification performance.

E. Threshold Analysis

Analysis of prediction probability distributions revealed clear separation between flood and non-flood classes:
   - Maximum probability for no-flood predictions: 10.16 percent
   - Minimum probability for flood predictions: 24.13 percent
   - Separation gap: 13.97 percentage points

This substantial gap indicates that the model produces confident predictions with minimal uncertainty in the boundary region, supporting reliable risk classification.

G. Discussion

The results demonstrate that the Random Forest algorithm, when trained on high-quality official flood records, can achieve exceptional performance in flood prediction for Paranaque City. The perfect classification achieved on the official records dataset indicates a strong correlation between the documented flood events and the corresponding weather conditions.

The dominance of precipitation as a predictive feature aligns with the understanding that rainfall intensity is the primary driver of urban flooding. The significant contribution of interaction features suggests that the combination of multiple weather factors (e.g., high humidity combined with heavy precipitation) provides additional predictive value beyond individual features alone.

The three-level risk classification system translates model outputs into actionable information that can support decision-making by local government officials and community members. The probability thresholds were designed to balance sensitivity (catching potential flood events) with specificity (avoiding excessive false alarms).

The integration of multiple weather data sources through APIs ensures system resilience and data redundancy. The Meteostat service provides a cost-effective solution for historical data access, while OpenWeatherMap enables real-time weather monitoring for operational predictions.

Limitations of the current study include the reliance on weather station data that may not capture localized rainfall variations within the city, and the potential for overfitting when model performance approaches 100 percent accuracy. Future iterations should incorporate additional data sources and conduct validation with independent test datasets.


V. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Conclusion

This study successfully developed Floodingnaque, a real-time flood detection and early warning system for Paranaque City that integrates weather APIs with Random Forest-based machine learning prediction. The following conclusions are drawn from the research:

1. Effective System Architecture: The integration of Flask-based backend APIs with multiple weather data services (Meteostat, OpenWeatherMap) provides a robust and scalable architecture for flood prediction. The system successfully retrieves, processes, and utilizes weather data for prediction purposes.

2. High Prediction Accuracy: The Random Forest classifier achieved excellent performance metrics (100 percent accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) when trained on official flood records from the Paranaque City DRRMO. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble machine learning methods for flood prediction in the local context.

3. Significant Feature Insights: Feature importance analysis identified precipitation as the primary predictor (33.77 percent), followed by humidity-precipitation interaction (25.53 percent) and temperature-precipitation interaction (20.85 percent). These findings validate the importance of rainfall data in flood prediction and highlight the value of engineered interaction features.

4. Practical Risk Classification: The three-level risk classification system (Safe, Alert, Critical) effectively translates model predictions into actionable warnings that can guide emergency response and community preparedness activities.

5. Value of Official Records: The use of official DRRMO flood records provided a high-quality, locally relevant dataset that enabled the development of a prediction model specifically tailored to Paranaque City's flood patterns and conditions.

B. Recommendations

Based on the findings of this study, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. For System Enhancement:
   - Integrate additional weather data sources including radar-based precipitation estimates
   - Implement real-time data streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for continuous alert updates
