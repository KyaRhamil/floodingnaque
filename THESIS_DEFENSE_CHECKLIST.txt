  Parañaque City Flood Detection System
================================================================================

PREPARED BY: [Your Name]
DATE: December 12, 2025
THESIS: Random Forest-Based Flood Prediction System

================================================================================
  QUICK ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q1: Can I add new CSV files for training?
A1: YES! Very easy:
    cd backend
    python scripts/train.py --data data/your_new_file.csv

    Or merge multiple files:
    python scripts/merge_datasets.py --input "data/*.csv"

Q2: How does model versioning work?
A2: Automatic versioning on every training:
    Training #1 → flood_rf_model_v1.joblib + flood_rf_model_v1.json
    Training #2 → flood_rf_model_v2.joblib + flood_rf_model_v2.json
    Training #3 → flood_rf_model_v3.joblib + flood_rf_model_v3.json
    
    Each version stores: model, metadata, training date, dataset,
    parameters, metrics, feature importance

  DEFENSE QUESTIONS - PREPARED ANSWERS
================================================================================

Q: Why did you choose Random Forest?
A: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple 
   decision trees for robust predictions. It's ideal for our flood 
   prediction task because:
   - Handles non-linear weather patterns
   - Provides feature importance (shows which factors matter)
   - Resistant to overfitting
   - Works well with limited data
   - Industry-standard for classification tasks

Q: How does Random Forest work?
A: Random Forest creates multiple decision trees (in our case, 200). Each 
   tree is trained on a random subset of data and features. When making a 
   prediction, each tree votes, and the majority decision is the final 
   prediction. This ensemble approach makes it more accurate and stable 
   than a single decision tree.

Q: What's your model's accuracy?
A: Our model achieves [X]% accuracy, with [Y]% precision and [Z]% recall. 
   We balanced these metrics because both false alarms and missed floods 
   have consequences. We used 10-fold cross-validation to ensure the model 
   generalizes well to new data.

Q: How do you handle new data?
A: Our system makes it very easy to integrate new data. We can:
   1. Add new CSV files to the data folder
   2. Use our merge tool to combine datasets
   3. Retrain the model with one command
   4. The system automatically versions models
   5. We can compare new vs old models to track improvement

Q: What's the 3-level risk classification?
A: Beyond binary flood/no-flood, we classify into:
   - Safe (Green): No flood risk, normal conditions
   - Alert (Yellow): Moderate risk, monitor conditions
   - Critical (Red): High risk, immediate action needed
   This considers both prediction probability and weather conditions,
   giving residents more actionable information.

Q: How did you optimize the model?
A: We used GridSearchCV to automatically test different parameter 
   combinations:
   - Number of trees (100, 200, 300)
   - Tree depth (None, 10, 20, 30)
   - Minimum samples for splits
   - Feature selection methods
   The system tested all combinations with cross-validation and selected
   the best parameters automatically.

Q: Which features are most important?
A: Based on feature importance analysis [check your chart]:
   1. Precipitation - [X]% importance
   2. Humidity - [Y]% importance
   3. Temperature - [Z]% importance
   This shows that rainfall is the primary flood indicator, which aligns
   with meteorological understanding.

Q: How do you prevent overfitting?
A: Multiple techniques:
   - Cross-validation during training
   - Limiting tree depth
   - Minimum samples per split/leaf
   - Testing on held-out data
   - Random feature selection per tree
   Our learning curves show the model generalizes well to unseen data.

  DEMO SCRIPT (If Asked to Show Live Prediction)
================================================================================

# Start the API server
cd backend
python main.py

# In another terminal, test prediction
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"temperature": 25.0, "humidity": 85.0, "precipitation": 20.0}'

Expected Response:
{
  "prediction": 1,
  "risk_level": 2,
  "risk_label": "Critical",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "probability": {"no_flood": 0.15, "flood": 0.85}
}

Explanation:
- Input: High humidity (85%) + significant rain (20mm)
- Output: Flood predicted (1) with 85% confidence
- Risk: Critical - immediate action required
