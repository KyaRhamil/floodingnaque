### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Every 5-7 days

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### API Keys and Secrets
- **NEVER** commit API keys, tokens, or secrets to the repository
- Use `.env` files for local development (already in `.gitignore`)
- Use `.env.example` with **placeholder values only**
- Rotate any accidentally exposed credentials immediately

### Environment Variables
Required secrets (store in `.env`, never commit):
- `WORLDTIDES_API_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (path to service account JSON)
- `SECRET_KEY` (Flask/API secret)

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies updated
- Run `pip audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities
- Review security advisories from Dependabot

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security report:
1. We confirm the vulnerability
2. We develop and test a fix
3. We release the patch
4. We publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix is deployed
